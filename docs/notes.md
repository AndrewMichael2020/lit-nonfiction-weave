# Working Notes (human-owned; agents read-only after initial seed)

## Fragments
- "Wind moved like breath between rock fins."  ridge, morning  
- "She ran ahead hoping that I followed."  
- "The snow squeaked under her small boots; no sound after that."  
- "Phone light in Whistler parking lot, midnight."  
- "Border Peak ridge. A sky so white it erased edges."

## Places
- Canadian Border Peak upper ridge and summit cornice  
- Tomyhoi glacier benches in early season  
- Mount Wedg's Wedghemount Lake at dusk  
- Baker lower Easton Glacier, tents glowing blue  
- Whistler bus stop, highway sodium lights  

## People
REAL PEOPLE: 
- Nikita. Focus on her speed, warmth, and quiet pauses rather than dialogue.  
- Chris. Laughter, strength that cuts through fatigue.  
- Steven. Hands steady on stove lid.  
- Narrator. Always slightly behind.  

## Objects
- Borrowed helmet  
- Small headlamp with weak batteries  
- Coffee thermos on dashboard  
- Rope coiled but unused  

## Leads or Hunches
- The contrast between lightness and duty, climbing followed by work  
- How repetition makes confidence seem effortless  
- How fast learning feels in the mountains before risk catches up  
- The absence of glamour. Ordinary gear, cheap gloves, long drives  
- The story should end where detail equals silence, not grief, just quiet  

## Voice Reminders
- Keep language restrained and observational  
- Avoid explaining motives  
- Let sensory detail carry meaning
