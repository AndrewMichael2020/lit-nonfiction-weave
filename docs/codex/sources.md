# Method
- Combine public factual anchors ([S1]–[S4]) with firsthand recollection ([S5]).
- Imagined details limited to texture: light, movement, dialogue cadence.
- Temporal compression allowed to maintain narrative flow.
- Attribution mode: **mix** (quote factual + paraphrase emotional).

# Verification
- All factual mentions cross-checked against at least one external record.
- Sensitive material (family grief) referenced factually, never dramatized.
- All names already publicly visible; no new identification introduced.

# Output Use
- Feeds FactAgent and PlannerAgent grounding layers.
- Enables hedging control: low (realistic tone) to medium (literary inference).
- Scene compression allowed up to 40 %.
