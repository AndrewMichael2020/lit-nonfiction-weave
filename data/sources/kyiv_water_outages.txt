Kyiv water utility Kyivvodokanal reported rolling outages affecting districts 4-7 on February 24, 2022, following infrastructure strikes. High-rise buildings above the fifth floor experienced complete water loss due to insufficient pressure from electric booster stations. The Dnipro river serves as the primary water source through three major intake stations. Soviet-era pipeline infrastructure, installed in the 1960s-1980s, requires electric pumping to maintain pressure in multi-story residential buildings. Generator backup systems at treatment facilities provided limited coverage during power outages lasting 6-12 hours.
