AUTHOR INTENT

I want a literary short story in English that portrays the short, bright mountaineering life of Nikita Marwah [E1], who died shortly after turning twenty-three.
The tone should be quiet, observational, and restrained, suitable for publication in a serious literary magazine.
Imagination is permitted only within the verified factual world defined below.
The story must integrate documented events with sensory realism and emotional precision.

The narrative voice (Narrator) should remain factual, non-sentimental, and first-person, describing climbs and memories shared with Nikita in the Pacific Northwest.
The story should evoke youth, risk, and brevity without fictionalizing biography beyond normal narrative inference.

FACTUAL GROUNDING

Verified facts and allowable anchors:

Nikita Marwah climbed actively in British Columbia and Washington during a brief but intense period (2020–2023).

She died on Canadian Border Peak after a successful solo summit, unroped and without a helmet.

Her death was publicly acknowledged by her family in a GoFundMe statement.

Her frequent partners included Chris (later died  on Atwell Peak) and Steven.

She was known for fast, light ascents and rapid learning with limited formal training.

All geography, route names, and environmental details must remain geographically accurate to the Pacific Northwest.

Appearance (from verifiable photograph):
Petite, lightly built; dark hair worn simply; dark eyes with focused expression; youth and quiet confidence visible in face and posture.
Descriptions should remain respectful and observational, avoiding dramatization or speculative emotion.

REQUIRED SCENES AND EVENTS

Tomyhoi Peak: She forgot her helmet; I lent her mine. No rope used.

Mount Wedge: Solo climb; late descent; midnight call from Whistler after missing the last bus; early-morning work shift following day.

Mount Baker (May 1–2): Joint ascent; she summited, I turned back at 11 a.m. due to exhaustion; we descended via a difficult moraine.

Forbidden Peak, West Ridge: She reached Cat Scratch Gully, evaluated fourth-class start, decided to turn back.

Scenes with Chris and Steven: depict shared energy and youth; mention Chris’s later fatal accident on Atwell Peak factually and briefly.

Optional interstitial moments:
camp mornings, roadside breakfasts, quiet conversations at trailheads, reflections during approaches, unguarded dialogue revealing personality and ethos.

ALLOWED FICTIONALIZATION

Realistic dialogue consistent with climbing culture between the narrator, Nikita, Chris, and Steven.

Imagined but plausible weather, sensory, and environmental descriptions (light, snow texture, wind).

Reflective or interior monologue by the narrator that interprets experience without inventing unverified facts.

Travel details and logistics inferred from normal climbing practice.

Moderate scene compression for pacing (no invented accidents or achievements).

NOT ALLOWED

Any speculative or invented biography outside verifiable timeframe and geography.

Supernatural, symbolic, or mythic interpretation of events.

Negative portrayal of real persons or attribution of statements not publicly recorded.

Glamourization of risk or romanticization of death.

Direct emotional representation of Nikita’s family or private grief.

THEMES

Youth in the mountains.

Skill acquired quickly under constraint of time.

Awareness of risk and deliberate restraint.

The dual nature of lightness — grace versus vulnerability.

What remains after a short, intense life in motion.

The thin line between preparation and acceptance.
