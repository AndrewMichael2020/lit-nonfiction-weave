### BEAT: white-opening-border-peak

Canadian Border Peak is loose metamorphic ribs and steep snow gullies near Chilliwack, where British Columbia meets Washington along a ridge so narrow the sky erased its edges. Nikita Marwah summited alone in conditions that turned the air white—no rope, no helmet, the same lightness she carried on Tomyhoi and Wedge and Baker. She did not return. Her family confirmed the death through GoFundMe, a single factual sentence that named the mountain and the date.  The stillness after ascent is not metaphor. Wind moved like breath between rock fins. The snow squeaked under her small boots where the slope steepened, then no sound after that. She had driven the Sea-to-Sky corridor dozens of times, alone or with Steven or Chris, stove hissing at dawn in trailhead camps, maps spread across dashboards, bus timetables memorized for returns to work. On Tomyhoi she forgot her helmet; I lent her mine. On Wedge she called from Whistler near midnight, phone light pale in the parking lot, voice calm with fatigue. On Baker she moved fast while I turned back.  Border Peak was completion, not warning. The ridge holds what happened without commentary.

### BEAT: tomyhoi-helmet-trust

Early daylight on Tomyhoi. The glacier line and rocky ridge stood visible from Baker, sharp against morning air. Nikita forgot her helmet at the trailhead. I lent her mine without comment. She adjusted the straps once, nodded, and started up.  We moved light and unroped. The snow squeaked under her small boots. She set a pace I could follow but didn't wait—just glanced back once to confirm I was there. No rope required. The terrain opened clean: rock fins and névé, nothing technical.  Her confidence wasn't loud. She placed her feet carefully, tested holds with her fingertips, moved on. I watched her read the ridge the way some people read trail signs—quick, certain, minimal hesitation. Wind moved like breath between rock fins, steady and cold.  Trust built itself through small acts. The helmet. The shared pacing. The silence that didn't need filling. She didn't ask if I was tired. I didn't ask if she was sure. We just moved, and the movement was enough.  At the summit she sat on a flat stone, pulled out a granola bar, ate half. Handed me the rest. Below us the border ran invisible through gullies and glacier. Above, only wind and light.

### BEAT: corridor-transit-independence

Between 2020 and 2023, Nikita traveled the Sea-to-Sky Corridor alone—buses from Squamish, rides from Whistler, a worn pack wedged between her knees. She kept a job and stacked climbs on weekends, moving through trailheads at dawn with the stove hiss and the smell of instant coffee. Maps and timetables were as real as crampons. Distance was material.  She called from Whistler Village after midnight once, voice quiet after Mount Wedge. Phone light in the parking lot. The narrator drove up before her shift started. On Tomyhoi, she forgot her helmet; he lent his. On Baker, she summited light while he turned back at eleven, exhausted. At Cat Scratch Gully below Forbidden's west ridge, she assessed the fourth-class start and chose not to go higher.  She moved fast, learned quickly, spoke little. Wind moved like breath between rock fins. The snow squeaked under her small boots. No sound after that.

### BEAT: baker-fork-light-and-heavy

We left the trailhead at four. Cold morning brightness on the Coleman Glacier, sastrugi ridges catching first light. Nikita carried a daypack—water, shell, headlamp. I had tent, stove, rope we wouldn't use. The snow squeaked under her small boots. She moved ahead in steady rhythm, no wasted motion, while I sank and reset my pace every twenty steps.  By nine the sun had softened everything. Wind moved like breath between rock fins. She waited at the bergschrund, then continued when I waved her on. At eleven I turned back. Exhaustion, not fear. She nodded and kept climbing.  I descended alone, set camp at the moraine. Stove hiss at dawn. She returned near noon the next day, face calm, no summit photo, just the fact of it. We packed in silence. On the drive south through the Sea-to-Sky corridor she slept against the window.  Later I would think of that fork—lightness versus weight, her small pack against my heavy one. No judgment in it. Just two ways of moving through the same white world. She chose hers with the same quiet attention she gave to route-finding: observant, economical, complete.

### BEAT: forbidden-assessment-restraint

Boston Basin under Johannesburg at dawn. Stove hiss, then the slow walk up scree toward Forbidden's West Ridge. Steven carried the rope. Nikita moved ahead, light pack, no helmet again. I followed with the rack.  Cat Scratch Gully opened steep and loose above us. Fourth-class rock, wet from overnight melt. She stopped at the base, studied the line for a long time. Wind moved like breath between the fins. Steven set down his pack, pulled the topo, traced the route with one gloved finger.  "Doesn't feel right," she said. Quiet, not disappointed.  Steven nodded. "We can come back."  She looked up once more, then turned. No argument. We descended the same scree, retraced boot prints to camp. Steven reminded us to clip the stove fuel. Small things. He always did.  At the trailhead she laughed—short, tired. "Good day anyway."  Restraint as its own ascent. The decision to stop held the same weight as any summit. She understood that. Steven too. The ridge would wait. Or it wouldn't. Either way, we'd chosen correctly.  Later I would think of this morning often. How she assessed the gully, how she turned without drama. How Steven's steadiness made space for her speed. The balance they found.  We drove back down the Sea-to-Sky in silence, mountains passing like breath.

### BEAT: wedge-whistler-midnight

Mount Wedge was her longest solo that spring. She called from Whistler around midnight, voice flat with fatigue. I drove up the Sea-to-Sky in silence, windows cracked against the diesel smell near Squamish. The parking lot was nearly empty. Coffee scent drifted from a closing café. Her phone light bobbed near the curb.  She climbed in without ceremony. No story about the ridge, no mention of the moraine she'd crossed alone in afternoon glare. Her boots were caked with pale dust. She had an early shift at six.  "Long day," I said.  "Yeah."  We didn't talk after that. Independence wasn't posture or bravado. It was this: the drive back down the corridor in darkness, her head tipped against the window, the fact that she'd returned. The ridge had been narrow. The wind had moved like breath between rock fins. She'd descended in her own time, called when she needed to, asked for nothing else.  By the time we reached her apartment, the sky over the inlet was beginning to pale. She thanked me once, shouldered her pack, and was gone before I could answer.

### BEAT: chris-laughter-and-after

Chris met us at trailheads along the Sea-to-Sky corridor that spring—Squamish, Chilliwack Valley, the long gravel roads that ended in dust and morning cold. He moved with easy laughter, eager to test new lines, trading beta across rope teams while stoves hissed at dawn. Nikita shared early miles with him: the same lightness, the same willingness to move fast over loose metamorphic rock. They joked through fatigue, helmets absent more often than present, packs stripped to nothing but water and a shell.  I remember his voice at the Tomyhoi trailhead, asking about the ridge conditions. Wind moved like breath between rock fins that day. The snow squeaked under boots. No one carried much weight.  A year after Border Peak, Chris died on Atwell with two companions. The accident was reported plainly in the BC Mountaineering Club summary—date, elevation, conditions. No moral embedded. Just the fact of it, marked in local memory the way all such losses are: quietly, among those who knew the same ridges, the same midnight drives, the same phone calls from Whistler parking lots under harsh white light. Youth and risk, held together without commentary.

### BEAT: border-peak-place-returns

Canadian Border Peak sits on the line between British Columbia and Washington, a ridge of metamorphic rock that sheds holds and gathers snow in steep gullies. The geometry is simple: a long approach through Chilliwack Valley timber, then open slopes where wind moves like breath between rock fins. Nikita went alone in late spring. No rope. No helmet. Her style had been constant since Tomyhoi—light, deliberate, unhurried in its own way.  The snow squeaked under her small boots. She reached the summit. The sky was white enough to erase edges, the kind of light that makes distance uncertain. She stood where the border runs invisible through stone, youth on one side, completion on the other. Then she began descending.  What happened in the gully is documented only by absence. A fall on steep snow, the metamorphic looseness that defines the range. No one saw. The quiet that weather imposes became permanent.  Steven had climbed with her on other peaks, reminded her of small safety routines. Chris would die on Atwell Peak the following year with two companions. The narrator had lent her his helmet on Tomyhoi, picked her up from Whistler after Wedge, turned back on Baker while she continued. None of that changed the ridge.  Her family confirmed it through GoFundMe. The Sea-to-Sky corridor she'd traveled so often—bus timetables, trailhead laughter, stove hiss at dawn—became a route that ended. Border Peak remains: loose rock, steep snow, the borderline she crossed alone.

### BEAT: camps-rituals-counterpoint

The camps were always the same: gravel pullouts along the Chilliwack Valley, slabs at Boston Basin where the stove hissed at dawn and Steven checked buckles twice before we moved. Nikita shared the driver's seat with him once, both asleep after Tomyhoi, damp straps coiled between their boots. Chris laughed at trailheads, easy and loud, while she stayed quiet, tightening her pack until it sat high and light.  These rituals were the counterweight. The ordinary life that climbs were set within.  Phone light in a Whistler parking lot, midnight, after she descended Wedge alone. Stove hiss before Baker. The snow squeaking under her small boots on the Coleman Glacier while I turned back at eleven, too tired to follow. Her helmet absent on Border Peak, present on Tomyhoi only because I lent mine.  Wind moved like breath between rock fins. Maps and bus timetables. Quiet returns down the Sea-to-Sky corridor, distance collapsing into fatigue and the smell of coffee at gas stations. The borderlines—BC and Washington, ridge edges erased by white sky—meant less than the rhythm of packing out, driving home, working the next day, planning the next line.

### BEAT: memory-local-and-quiet

The names accumulate quietly. Canadian Border Peak in late spring, then Atwell the following year. Two accidents, two climbers who moved through the same corridors—Sea-to-Sky, North Cascades—carrying light packs and minimal rope.  Nikita forgot her helmet on Tomyhoi. I lent her mine. The ridge was dry, the glacier firm under morning sun. She moved ahead, small boots finding purchase on metamorphic holds, and I followed the line she chose. Wind moved like breath between rock fins. At the summit we ate trail mix and descended without speaking much.  On Wedge, she soloed the long moraine and narrow ridge. Her call came near midnight from a Whistler parking lot, phone light pale against her face. I drove up before her shift started. She was tired but steady.  Baker was different. I turned back at eleven, exhausted by weight and altitude. She continued with her small pack, no stove, no tent. The Coleman Glacier route is straightforward if you move fast.  Chris laughed easily at trailheads. He and Nikita shared that lightness, the way fatigue became humor on descent. Steven reminded us about helmets, about checking weather. He drove often, prepped camp, survived.  Border Peak's ridge erases itself in certain light—snow so white the BC–Washington line disappears. The reports are brief. Club logs note conditions, nothing more. Atwell's entry is similarly spare.  Memory accrues this way: wind, squeaking snow, stove hiss at dawn, the stillness after ascent. No myth-making. Just the way a ridge looks different the next time you see it.

### BEAT: witness-narrator-stance

On Tomyhoi she forgot her helmet. I lent her mine and climbed behind, watching the dark braid swing across her shoulders as she moved up the ridge. Wind moved like breath between rock fins. She did not ask; I offered. That was how it worked.  On Baker I turned back at eleven, legs heavy, pack wrong. She continued light, reaching the summit hours later while I descended alone through soft snow. No shame in it. She ran ahead hoping that I followed, and sometimes I did not.  After Wedge I drove to Whistler near midnight, phone light bright in the parking lot. She emerged from the trailhead quiet, boots muddy, face calm. Work started at six. We said little on the drive back down the Sea-to-Sky corridor, headlights cutting fog.  Mentorship was not instruction. It was shared endurance and attention—stove hiss at dawn, the snow squeaking under her small boots, maps spread across hoods at trailheads. Steven reminded us of carabiners and weather windows. Chris laughed through fatigue. Nikita moved with a lightness I could not match, helmet absent more often than present, crossing borderlines between BC and Washington as though they were suggestions.  I was witness, not hero. She taught by moving. I learned by watching.

### BEAT: coda-stillness-and-line

The ridge on Canadian Border Peak erases its own edges in white weather. Wind moves like breath between rock fins. Snow squeaks under small boots, then stops.  Nikita climbed fast because she was light. She learned routes in months that took others years. On Tomyhoi she forgot her helmet; I lent mine. On Wedge she called from Whistler near midnight, voice calm, shift starting at six. On Baker she summited while I turned back at eleven, legs empty. At Cat Scratch Gully below Forbidden's west ridge she studied the rock, shook her head, walked down.  Chris laughed at trailheads, tested new lines, died on Atwell Peak the year after. Steven drove, reminded us to check stove fuel, survived. The Sea-to-Sky corridor compressed distance. Bus timetables and dawn cold became the rhythm between peaks.  Youth sharpens beauty by its brevity. The community adjusts its sense of time. We hold to completion rather than warning, listen for what remains: stove hiss, phone light in parking lots, the particular squeak of snow under boots too small for the cold.  The ridge holds its line. Wind continues. No sound after that.

Early daylight on Tomyhoi. The glacier line and rocky ridge stood visible from Baker, sharp against morning air. Nikita forgot her helmet at the trailhead. I lent her mine without comment.
